# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a contract generated by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Testing the contract

```
npm test
```

## Pre deployment
Copy the `.env-template` and rename it to `.env`

Make sure to add at least the admin private key before deplying the contract. 
This address is the owner of the contract. 

The remaining privat keys will be used in the GUI to test. So add at your leasure. 


## Deploying the contract

You can target any network from your Hardhat config using:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network besu
```
*Important*:
After copy the Contract Address from the CLI into the .env file to make sure you run all subsequent scripts on the right contract. 

## Interact with existing contract

Get the contract address and add it into either after_deploy.ts or gui.ts

gui.ts lets you interact with a cli that has all the functionality.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/gui.ts --network besu
```
